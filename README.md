# Household Power Consumption Forecasting Sequential Models

This project focuses on forecasting household power consumption using a variety of Sequential modeled architectures. We compare the performance of several deep learning models on time series data, including:

- Vanilla RNN
- Stacked RNN
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Vanilla LSTM
- Stacked LSTM
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
- Refined LSTM (custom-enhanced LSTM variant)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We used the **Household Power Consumption Dataset**, which contains measurements of electric power consumption in a single household over four years (2006-2010).

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

Each model was built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture details vary in depth and configuration:

- **Vanilla RNN** â€“ basic recurrent unit.
- **Stacked RNN** â€“ multiple RNN layers.
- **GRU** â€“ efficient gated recurrent unit.
- **Vanilla LSTM** â€“ traditional LSTM cell.
- **Stacked LSTM** â€“ deeper LSTM networks.
- **BiLSTM** â€“ bidirectional processing for richer context.
- **Refined LSTM** â€“ LSTM variant with architectural tweaks for better performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

We used the following metrics to evaluate model performance:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
