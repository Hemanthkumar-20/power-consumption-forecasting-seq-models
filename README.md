# âš¡ Household Power Consumption Forecasting with Sequential Models

This project focuses on forecasting household power consumption using a variety of sequential deep learning architectures. We compare the performance of several models on time series data:

- Vanilla RNN  
- Stacked RNN  
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
- Vanilla LSTM  
- Stacked LSTM  
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)  
- Refined LSTM (custom-enhanced LSTM variant)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We use the **Household Power Consumption Dataset**, which contains minute-level measurements of electric power consumption in a single household over a four-year period (2006â€“2010).

- **File Name**: `household_power_consumption.txt`

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

Each model was built and trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The models vary in depth and architectural style:

- **Vanilla RNN** â€“ Basic recurrent unit  
- **Stacked RNN** â€“ Multi-layer RNN for deeper learning  
- **GRU** â€“ Gated Recurrent Unit for efficient training  
- **Vanilla LSTM** â€“ Standard LSTM cell  
- **Stacked LSTM** â€“ Multi-layer LSTM for capturing deeper dependencies  
- **BiLSTM** â€“ Bidirectional LSTM for richer temporal context  
- **Refined LSTM** â€“ LSTM with architectural enhancements (e.g., dropout, attention)

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **MAE** â€“ Mean Absolute Error  
- **MSE** â€“ Mean Squared Error  
- **RMSE** â€“ Root Mean Squared Error
